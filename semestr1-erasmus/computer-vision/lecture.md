- computer vision
	- mimic human vision
	- extract measurable information
	- identify objects
	- fix/improve images to improve their interpretation
- image processing vs. computer vision
	- processing: reasoning focused on the image, pixels, pixel groups
	- vision: focuses on the knowledge the image brings from a real scene
- difficult problem
	- the goal of computer vision is not to mimic human vision but to build systems that extract information
	- computer vision is an inverse of the synthesis problem
		- projection is fundamentally ambiguous – we are losing information (depth, size, occlusions)
		- in general it's an ill-posed problem: no unique solution for a given observation, ambiguous solutions, incomplete data (example: scale of the observed scene, toy car instead of normal car)
		- need of injecting a priori knowledge and regularization (example: penalize non-smooth solutions)
	- from noisy observations, we estimate the parameters of a model
	- a priori knowledge: physics, geometry, semantics
	- example: by counting visible wheels of the car, we can tell the position of the camera
	- desirable characteristics
		- robustness – be able to identify observation noise/errors (have plan B in case of error)
		- speed
		- precision
		- generality – the algorithm should be generic; the pool of situations that it can handle should be large enough
